        "WHY WOODLANDS?! \n\n- You get JB at North, Hospital at South, Driving School at East, and Polyclinic/Stadium at West. \n- At most 20mins bus ride to interchange.\n- 20mins to Jalan Kayu Supper via 168\n- 25mins to Jurong via NSL.\n- 25-35mins to Sengkang via 161\n- 30-35mins to Orchard via TEL. \n- 30 to 60mins to JB from home. +1 if you stay near RTS. \n- 35 to 45mins to IKEA/Tampines via 168\n- Direct bus to Airport or 168 transfer 110/858! \n- Sit till end on TEL train \n\nWHY NOT?! \n- idk \ud83e\udd23\n\nOk maybe we might not have a mall as big as Northpoint, or a bus service that goes into Orchard daily like 190/972, but we have TEL/NSL. Even to places like Bugis or Chinatown, there\u2019s 960/e and 961/M! Still not too bad\u2026\ud83e\udd2d",

        "as a long time resident, I can say that Woodlands is the magic place where everywhere else seems far but not so far at the same time (compared to say, pioneer to pasir ris). Also +1 for being opposite JB",
        "Used to like living there...one by one all my green spaces went...something i took for granted...roads that generally used to be quite empty became crowded.\n\nAs for things being far away, having a car makes everything seem quite close\n\n\nAs for the jb factor, yeah its easy if my mom wants to wake up at 6 am to drag us there for shopping, other than that not to fond of that place",
        "It used to be the quietest and cheaper option. Unfortunately, it's getting overcrowded like the rest of Singapore now.",
        "Lol as someone who lived in Yew Tee most of my life, Woodlands is where I'd go to do find things to do...",
        "I live in Woodlands my whole life, but got a BTO in Tampines. MOP up, and we moved right back to Woodlands! It\u2019s really not that inaccessible - TEL is a game changer. Obv it\u2019s not as central when you compare it to towns like Bishan BUT it doesn\u2019t take that long to get to city area. It\u2019s abt 45 mins (factoring in the getting to train station), which imo is actually reasonable - in other cities in the world, this is considered really decent. For the psf you\u2019re paying for resale flats or condos here vs in a more central area, I think it\u2019s a fair trade off. \n\nThere are also plenty of options when it comes to food and shopping: Woods Square has plenty of food choices, CWP is decent (and not a maze like North Point), and if you drive, Jalan Legundi/ Chong Pang is 15 minutes away for even more food options. And of course there\u2019s always JB. When the RTS link is up, it\u2019s going to be even better. \n\nWoodlands is also a short drive to Mandai or Sungei Buloh, since having kids I realised been near the zoo is a big plus \ud83d\ude02\n\nThe biggest con I can think of is the lack of \u201cgood\u201d schools (which in turn also affects housing prices)\u2026but this is also highly subjective.",

        "for me, to JB 30min, to city 1 hr",

        "Pros:\n\nShort distance to travel if going to Malaysia.\n\nLower population, doesn't feel as rushy and crowded. \n\nNot exactly sure if pro because of woodlands, but jumbo flat, really spacious, basically 3 room and 4 room combined into one. Considering buying it over from parents and continue living in it. \n\nCons:\n\nEvery job for my field is at central-ish, annoying to travel so far.\n\nMost of the interesting stores doesn't open here. \n\nNothing really interesting or fun nearby.",
        "I have lived in Woodlands for almost 30 years. I still remember when Causeway Point wasn't even built. In recent years, I feel that the surrounding estates are all pretty dirty. Every night, the void decks around my neighbourhood are crawling with cockroaches. There's always trash lying around, and there's always some crazy fellow screaming in the evening. There's always people everywhere. We just have 1 central area that's somewhat nice but everything else is pretty crap. Just look at our pool. The toilets alone will traumatise you. \n\nI used to like it. Now I just feel like it's kind of like a border town. It's definitely much worse than Yishun in my opinion and I haven't even talked about the countless murders around the place.",
        "Being next to JB is probably the best flex",
        "One thing I like about Woodlands is that there's the huge patch of green forests beyond the SLE. Nowhere else can I find a proper plot of land that still retains the kampung feels (Ulu Sembawang) within a 5-10 minute cycle from a HDB estate. Have you seen the Ulu Sembawang Sunrise? https://mothership.sg/2021/06/cyclist-sunrise-ulu-sembawang/\n\nIt's a nice and fast escape from the concrete jungle. \n\nWell, one can say that Bukit Panjang and Bukit Batok also has that kind of forests nearby and within 5-10 minutes too, but they don't have the kampung feels because those are nature reserves.",

Telling the internet to not dox the kids is useless, since the internet is gonna internet, and parents want justice for their kid as the school doesn't seem to want to do anything about it. Moreover, it is the bullies who are stupid enough to record a video.\n\nI also note that apparently, the number of reported bullying cases have remained the same throughout the years. But if you think about it, the number of kids entering primary/secondary school has gone down (birth rates and all that). So proportionally, there are a higher percentage of reported bullying cases.

We have strict laws in sg to maintain order. Just because they are kids does not mean they aren't cognisant of what they are doing.

Instead she reverts to portraying herself as a little child (she\u2019s 30 years old this year with her own children, my gosh) in need of protection/guidance by Pritam. \n\nNo way someone of such moral fibre, lack of gumption/conviction/personal accountability, should ever represent Singapore as MP (or even as any leader in any organisation).",
        "Why are we listening to anything she says if she's been known to be a liar? Why is any of it valid in court?",
        "i frakking hate this BIATCH!!!",
        "This kind of traitor",
        "She is the biggest confirmation to the already woke-allergic majority of singaporeans that the former can barely camouflage their narcissistic self indulgence.",
        "She sounds like she\u2019s delusional and only hears what she wants to hear. \n\nNot only had she lied in parliament, she also lied to Pritam about still trying to contact the victim, because she \u201cwants it (the questioning by pritam) to go away\u201d. \n\nShe\u2019s also unclear about what Pritam said about taking it to the grave. Pritam said something about COP, and said something about taking it to the grave? Two matters are contradicting but she did not bother clarifying.",
        "&gt;Explaining why, Ms Khan said: \"Because there was no advice on actions to be taken, and Mr Singh said it would be something I would take to the grave, **so I assumed there was nothing I was going to do about it**.\"\n\n***Dun assume please***.\n\n&gt;She said if she had to do something, the team would have been drafting speeches for a clarification in parliament, or she would have been tasked with emailing the police with more information.\n\n*Given the size of the bomb you just planted, other people dont need time to think on what to do is it? Whole day come settle ur case only is it? You cannot* ***initiate anything yourself*** *is it?*\n\n&gt;She said she understood Singh's comment about taking it to the grave to mean \"that it wouldn't leave the room, that we won't talk about it anymore\".\n\n*Again you just assume it, why didn't you clarify if you had doubt.*\n\n&gt;After the meeting, she said she felt a \"huge sense of relief\" because she had told the truth to the people she trusted most in the party, and that she \"**didn't hold that lie in\u00a0(her)\u00a0anymore**\".\n\n*Madam, you only told 3 pax at that time and maintained that lie to the rest of Singapore.*\n\n*I am not sure how you felt relief by that.*",
        "Anything that comes out of this one mouth, cannot la bro",
        "what a setback for the opposition party, and for any young folks serious about getting into politics (as if it wasn't already hard enough for them before)\n\ntwo faced narcissistic bitch, sincerely hoping she never gets the things she wants in life",
        "She\u2019s a real khant",
        "She\u2019s going to singlehandedly destroy her party instead of taking the actual (minor) penalty. Thank the gods she isn\u2019t in politics anymore",
        "Can enlighten me why the person actually lying in parliament did not get charged to state courts, and instead serve as witness for the person she implicated and caused to become charged?",
        "lol shameless",
        "substantiate?",
        "Really burden. Hope her statement is taken with the lightest weight if any. The focus on only herself really shows how you cannot know how a person will be when interviewing them for a job. Everything is me me me",
        "Knn, when my boss highlight a part of my work and said explain more. I explain more. Don't understand I clarify. \n\nBloody hell if my boss need to sit me down to explain the severity, I better be fking stupid",
        "Curious, can she refuse if asked to testify by the prosecution?",
        "What a POS\u2026",
        "\"To hide a lie, a thousand lies are needed.\"\n\nCan't believe I was unfortunate enough to live in the part of Sengkang GRC under her and even helped out at MPS. Absolutely disgusting.",

        "You can tell how desperate PAP is getting when they rely on a proven liar to push forward their case so as to discredit an upright politician and brainwash the masses",
        "useless",
        "I'm sure she's no PAP mole but god damn, she tryna bring the whole party down with her.",
        "Is it me or do anyone also interpret that PS context of taking it to the grave is not meant to hide it but by punishing her (bringing her to COP) it would be something they have to take it to the grave considering of his close ties with his parents and how her dad probably donated to the party ?",
